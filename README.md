## Howto
### UploadData

Little piece of code to upload grades of students

To test it local: run php -S localhost:8000

### dropdown
Users can select a faculty, a program and a course from a dropdown.

  These options are shown in options.json

  The update of the dropdown happens in showDropdown.js

### Uploading

We expect the user to upload a csv file (, or ; separated) with two columns:

  studentid and grades

  The studentid must be an integer

  The grades must be an integer between 0 and 20 or # or NA

  This checking happens in upload.php

  There are some sample files in the folder samples to illustrate

### Saving

We save the grades in ../uploads

### Converting

When the grades are uploaded, we convert all of them in a json file

  We do this in the parseCSV.py file

  run python parseCSV.Py
